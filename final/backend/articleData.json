    "content": "COVID-19 has been found to cause issues in various parts of the body, not just the lungs. The liver, immune system, and reproductive system can also be affected if you catch coronavirus.\n\nAlthough research is still limited on the topic, scientists have found that catching COVID-19 appears to impact male and female fertility. New studies suggest these effects are temporary rather than permanent. There’s also no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines impact fertility.\n\nLet’s dive into the latest data.\n\nCOVID and female fertility: The facts\n\nIn March 2021, scientists in Wuhan, China, found that catching COVID-19 might interfere with female fertility, causing some women’s menstrual cycles to become irregular. In some cases, COVID was found to also decrease markers of fertility by affecting the ovaries and disrupting sex hormone levels. Let’s go over exactly how this happens.\n\nACE2 is a cell receptor that COVID-19 uses to enter the body. There is a lot of ACE2 in the ovaries, uterus, and vagina. They play an important role in our cycles by, for example, picking up signals to make sure we ovulate regularly or that a fertilized egg develops into an embryo.\n\nCOVID-19 might interfere with these signals by harming tissue in the ovaries, reducing egg quality (making it more difficult for them to be fertilized), and damaging cells that are important for reproduction.\n\nIn fact, the Wuhan study — published in Frontiers in Medicine — looked at the impact coronavirus has on fertility by monitoring 78 women who had COVID. They found that the virus disrupts female sex hormone levels, such as anti-Mullerian hormone, and also negatively impacts ovarian reserve (the number and quality of eggs in the ovaries) as well as endocrine function via ACE2. The problem may be even worse for those of us with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as PCOS can already cause issues with hormone levels and fertility.\n\nBut, a January 2022 review of COVID-19 and fertility studies found that changes to hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and menstrual cycle length brought on by catching the virus were temporary in most cases.\nIt’s important to remember that research into COVID and fertility is ongoing, and more studies are needed to determine the long-term impact.",

    "content": "How does obesity impact your cycle and your hormones?\n\nAccording to Dr. DeTata, the relationship between fat cells, the ovaries, reproductive hormones, and the menstrual cycle is very complex.\n\n“Fat cells are more than just storage places for extra energy. They can make substances that affect ovarian production of hormones, and they can change the hormones made by the ovaries so that they act differently in the body. Estrogens and progesterone — hormones made by the ovaries — can affect the fat cells themselves, and they can also act on the brain to change behavior that may lead to changes in activity and eating that can increase or decrease weight. \n\n“To make this even more complicated, there are other things that influence hormones, such as genetics, stress, age, sleep, environment, and probably other factors that we do not understand yet.”\n\nThe connection between obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a common cause of irregular menstrual periods and infertility, says Dr. DeTata. It can also be associated with heavy bleeding, acne, male pattern hair growth, and storing fat around the midsection. \n\n“Along with the menstrual cycle and infertility problems that PCOS causes, it can also impact a person’s health over their lifetime. People with PCOS are more likely to have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial cancer.”\n\nDr. DeTata says that not everyone with PCOS is obese. In fact, 60 percent of people with PCOS are obese, but the other 40 percent are either normal weight or underweight. \n\n“Obese or not, PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, increasing the risk of diabetes. There are insulin receptors on the ovaries, and when obese person become more obese, their PCOS worsens,” she explains. \nSome diabetes medications can improve fertility and make menstrual cycles more regular in people with PCOS. For people who are overweight or obese, losing weight also improves ovulation and the regularity of menstrual cycles and decreases infertility, according to Dr. DeTata.\n\nWhich is more dangerous, obesity in pregnancy or pregnancy after bariatric surgery?\n\nDr. DeTata says that it depends on the degree of obesity and the type of weight-loss (or bariatric) surgery.  \n“Obesity can lead to many problems with pregnancy, and the risk increases with BMI. \n“BMI, or body mass index, is a measure of your weight in comparison to your height. BMI has a few different categories. A BMI between 18–24 is normal; between 25–30 is overweight; and a BMI over 30 is considered obese.  Pregnancies become more dangerous as BMI increases. There are several different types of surgery for obesity. Some surgeries are linked to more nutritional deficiencies, which can complicate pregnancy.”\n\nDr. DeTata advises talking to your health care provider before surgery about your plans to have a baby so you can go over the pros and cons of each type of surgery.\n\nHow soon is it safe to get pregnant after bariatric surgery?\n\nMost people lose weight rapidly during the first 12–18 months after bariatric surgery. Dr. DeTata says it’s best to avoid pregnancy until your weight loss reaches a plateau. Many people find that their overall well-being increases with weight loss and exercise. \n\n“Losing weight makes it easier to exercise, and more exercise makes it easier to lose weight,” she says.\n\nIf you have struggled with infertility, or haven’t thought about birth control previously, it’s important to remember that losing weight may increase your fertility. “It’s a good idea to use contraception until you‘re ready to conceive,” she says.",

    "content": "What is considered advanced maternal age?\n\nAccording to Dr. DeTata, 35 is the starting point for advanced maternal age.  \n\n“For many reasons, people delay having a baby to an older age, and this is becoming more popular. Celebrity stories in the media can make it seem common and easy to have a baby after 35 or even many years later. Advances in infertility treatments and the ability to save eggs and embryos make it easier to get pregnant after 40.”  \n\nShe says that despite developments and improvements in the ability to take care of older pregnant people, the risks of advanced maternal age still exist and it becomes even riskier as age increases. Multiple pregnancies, which can be common after infertility treatments, also increase the risks.\n\nRisks of advanced maternal age\nRisks for the pregnant person\n\nDr. DeTata says that with age, people are more likely to have chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and thyroid disease. Even when the person is healthy prior to pregnancy, the physical stress of pregnancy can make pregnancy problems more common.  ",

When talking to your doctor before surgery, please discuss your plans to have a baby so that you can learn about the pros and cons of each type of surgery,” says Dr. DeTata.\n\n“One study done in Sweden compared women who had had bariatric surgery before pregnancy with women who did not. They found that the risk of birth defects of the baby was lower in women who had bariatric surgery.”\n\nWhat are the risks of obesity in pregnancy?\n\nDr. DeTata names several risks obesity carries during pregnancy:\n\nIncreased risk of sleep apnea\nGestational diabetes\nHypertension\nPreeclampsia\nStroke\nPulmonary embolism  \n\nAdditionally, obese people have longer labors, and it is more difficult to monitor the baby during labor. There is also a higher chance of having a cesarean delivery.\n\n“What’s more, obese people have an increased risk of complications after cesarean, such as wound infections or clots in the legs, compared to people who aren’t obese. They require early testing for gestational diabetes, careful monitoring of their blood pressure, and assessment for other medical problems related to obesity at the start of their pregnancy.”\n\nThere are also risks for the baby:\n\nIncreased risk of miscarriage\nNeural tube defects\nUndiagnosed fetal anomalies due to impact on diagnostic testing\nDifficult delivery\nGrowth problems\nPreterm birth\nStillbirth\n\nAccording to Dr. DeTata, losing weight before you conceive is the best way to prevent these problems.",

However, the reality is that pregnancy sickness, fatigue, and unexpected cravings can make this really difficult, even if you’re trying your best. \n\nBut as your body changes and your baby grows, you need more of certain vitamins during pregnancy, which is where prenatal vitamins and other supplements come in. They can help you make sure you get what you both need. So which prenatal supplements for pregnancy should you buy?\n\nYour health care provider will be able to guide you through pregnancy, explain which supplements are okay to take, and may be able to help you find alternatives if you need them. They will assess the risks and benefits to help you decide what’s safe. Before you start taking any new vitamins, herbal remedies, and supplements, you should always speak to your medical professional. \n\nWe asked two Flo experts — registered dietitian Lauren Talbert and obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) Dr. Jenna Flanagan — to explain what you and your baby need as your pregnancy progresses and what to scan the label for. \n\nWhat are prenatal vitamins and other supplements?\n\nWhile your health care provider has no doubt advised you against “eating for two,” your body goes through some pretty huge changes during pregnancy and you might have experienced new pregnancy cravings. Because of this, you have increased nutritional needs. You’re growing another person, after all. \n\nDuring pregnancy, your body will prioritize your baby. This means that the baby will take any macronutrients (e.g., fats, proteins, and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals) that they need to develop from your reserves. Prenatal supplements can give you a boost of nutrients quickly and easily, so you don’t lose out (sometimes referred to as nutrient deficiencies). ",

While the movies (and your sex education at school) might suggest that you’d conceive the first time you have sex without using birth control, it can actually be a little bit more difficult. So, when is the best time to get pregnant? \n\nResearch has shown that around 85% of couples will conceive within their first year of trying. And if you want to have a baby, you’re probably curious about how to increase your chances of conceiving sooner. \n\nYou can do this by better understanding your cycle as a whole — from your period to an egg being released for fertilization (also known as ovulation) — by using an app like Flo and getting guidance from your health care provider. Here, two Flo medical board experts explain when the best time to have sex to get pregnant is and why a sex schedule might not be the worst idea in the world. \n\nWhen is the best time to try to get pregnant?\n\nYour menstrual cycle describes a series of changes that you’ll experience every month, triggered by the rise and fall of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. It can be split into two phases: the luteal and follicular phases. Their medical names can sound daunting, but they’re pretty easy to understand. \n\nDay one of your menstrual cycle aligns with the first day of your period, and the last day is marked by the start of your next period. The average cycle is 28 days, but if yours is between 21 and 35 days, it’s still considered typical. You can track your period using an app like Flo to find out how long yours is. \n\nWhile there’s no golden day in your cycle where you’re guaranteed to conceive (sadly), to understand the best time to get pregnant, it can be helpful to get into the nitty-gritty of what your hormones are doing before and after your period.

    "tag": "Trouble conceiving",
    "content": "Having a baby after experiencing pregnancy or baby loss can feel like a rainbow after a storm. It’s something that many families experience, with 10% to 15% of known pregnancies sadly ending in miscarriage and around 2 million babies being stillborn every year. But while this experience is universal, it will mean something different to every parent. \n\nIt’s natural that conceiving a rainbow baby after a loss can bring continuing grief and even guilt along with feelings of happiness and relief. This can be a confusing time, but everyone is different, and it’s important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to feel.\n\nWhat is a rainbow baby?\n\nA rainbow baby is the name given to a child born to parents who have previously lost a baby. The original loss could have been through a miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, or death during infancy. While, for many, the term provides comfort and a language to communicate their intricate emotions, others feel that the phrase fails to acknowledge their ongoing grief.\n\nHow does it feel to have a rainbow baby?\n\nWhen Iwona, 35, from Coventry, UK, found out she was pregnant with her rainbow baby Eilal, her overriding feelings were fear and denial. It took her 11 weeks to contact a midwife. “I thought, if I go to a professional, and this pregnancy becomes ‘real’, then anything can happen,” she says. “If I denied the fact that I was pregnant, I wouldn’t find out that something was wrong with the baby. I was protecting myself.”\n\nTwo years earlier, Iwona’s baby Muhammad had been stillborn at 20 weeks old. “I don’t even fully remember the first week after he was born. My brain was just not working properly. I couldn’t eat. We had to tell the kids that the sibling they were waiting for was not coming home,” says Iwona, who already had four young children. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, Iwona found herself consumed with feelings of guilt. “Did I do something wrong?” she says. “I even questioned whether I’d drunk too much coffee or eaten too many sweets, and that had caused him harm. It was this constant blaming and constant, constant thinking.”\n\nIt’s crucial to remember that stillbirth is almost never the mother’s fault. “The most common causes of stillbirth are related to issues with the placenta, with the baby (such as birth defects or chromosomal issues), or maternal medical issues, and some are unexplained,” says Dr. Amanda Kallen, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Endocrinology at Yale University. “It’s important to remember that finding out the cause of the loss does not mean assigning blame.” ",

    "content": "Egg retrieval day (also known as egg collection) is a pivotal moment in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment and can also be used in egg freezing too. After 10 days of medication and perhaps months of anticipation, it’s finally time to discover how many eggs your ovaries have been busy producing. \n\nThe results of the egg retrieval process will ultimately determine how many embryos you have to choose from for transfer day. It’s understandable, then, that this can feel like a tense part of an already emotionally charged process. With so much riding on the procedure, you may feel under pressure, which is completely natural. But the more information you have, the better you’ll know what to expect and the calmer you might feel. So read on as a fertility expert takes you through exactly what happens during the IVF egg retrieval process and what the outcome might mean for your fertility journey.\n\nWhen is egg retrieval done?\n\nThere are several steps in the average IVF journey, and egg retrieval comes about halfway through. One cycle of IVF can take three to six weeks, and the stages typically involve:\n\nSynchronizing eggs, typically with hormones (either oral or injectable), so they grow together\nStimulating the ovaries to produce as many eggs as possible (also injecting a tailored prescription of fertility drugs) \nInjecting the trigger shot\nEgg retrieval at the clinic\nFertilization in the lab\nEmbryo transfer\n\nLeading up to egg retrieval procedure, your menstrual cycle needs to be suppressed, either by self-administered daily injections or with birth control pills or estrogen patches. This allows the doctor to control your cycle more effectively, so your body produces a more predictable response to the egg stimulation medication. \n\nYou’ll start taking a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), or a combination of both to increase the number of eggs that the follicles in your ovaries produce. The idea is that the more eggs that are collected and fertilized, the greater chance you will have of finding a healthy egg that could go on to produce a baby. This is especially important because not every follicle will produce an egg.\n\nDuring this part of the process, which usually takes around one to two weeks, you’ll be called into the clinic regularly for scans on your ovaries to make sure the drugs are working. Your sonographer will document how big the follicles are at the scans. Then the date of your egg collection will be calculated based on how well your body is responding.\n\nJust before egg retrieval day, you’ll be given a “trigger shot.” This is a shot of a hormone that helps your eggs to mature in the ovaries. The egg retrieval process then takes place at your fertility clinic approximately 36 hours later.\n\nHow long does egg retrieval take?\n\nIVF egg retrieval is a fairly quick process, taking just 20 minutes. But how does it work?\n\nFirst, sedation or anesthesia will be used to make sure you don’t feel any pain. A specially trained health care professional will then perform the procedure by placing a needle through the vagina into each ovary, using ultrasound as a guide. They will then retrieve multiple eggs from your ovarian follicles via a suction device.\n\nWhile you’re in the recovery room taking it easy before heading home, your doctor will let you know how many eggs they’ve retrieved. What happens next depends on what kind of IVF treatment you’re having (fresh or frozen). \n\nIn both cases, the clinic will mix the eggs with sperm in the lab, and some will fertilize (they’ll keep you updated on how many have fertilized over the next few days — not every egg will survive, and that’s normal). Then, the fertilized eggs (now called embryos) will be graded based on quality. In a fresh transfer, your fertility doctor will transfer one or two embryos (depending on your fertility plan) into your uterus around 2 to 5 days after egg collection. In a frozen IVF cycle, the embryos will be graded and then frozen around days 5 to 7, ready to be thawed when you want to use them.",

In fact, a recent study of births around the world found that the global twinning rate has increased by a third since the 1980s, with approximately 1.6 million twins being born every single year. \n\nResearchers believe that one of the most important reasons for this increase is the coinciding rise in the use of fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). But what are the chances of having IVF twins, and how does it happen? \n\nFlo spoke to Dr. Lucky Sekhon, an OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist), reproductive endocrinologist, and infertility specialist, to answer all of our questions. We also hear from Gillian Harvey, an author who’s had IVF twins (as well as a single IVF baby), to hear more on what an IVF twin pregnancy feels like.\n\nHow are twins conceived?\n\nFirst, let’s refresh our minds on how twins are conceived. Nonidentical twins, or fraternal twins as they’re also known, are conceived when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. These are the most common type of twins. While exact percentages are unclear, research suggests that fraternal twins are also more common for older moms aged 35 and over, as hormonal changes can sometimes result in two eggs being released at the same time. This link may also be due to a higher rate of fertility treatment in older women.\n\nIdentical twins are more rare, resulting from a fertilized egg splitting and growing into two fetuses. The chances of having identical twins don’t differ according to age, but remain at around 1 in 250, or 0.4%.",

To help you understand each one properly, we spoke with obstetrician and gynecologist Allison K. Rodgers. Here, she helps break down all the similarities and differences in the “PCOS vs endo” conflict and answers some key questions about both.\n\n“[Two things] they definitely both have in common [are] that neither of these conditions are anyone’s fault, and both are very treatable,” says Dr. Rodgers.\n\nPCOS vs endometriosis: What’s the difference?\n\nBoth PCOS and endometriosis affect the reproductive system of people of childbearing age, so that usually means women and people who menstruate between the ages of 12 and 50. Unfortunately, they are chronic conditions, so although the symptoms might not always surface early on and diagnosis can take a while, they’re usually long-lasting.\n\nPCOS is a condition tied to your hormonal levels, and it usually causes an imbalance when it comes to your androgen hormones. Sometimes known as “male” hormones, these androgens are in charge of regulating much of your body and menstrual cycle. PCOS is sometimes — but, confusingly, not always — accompanied by one or more cysts forming in your ovaries, hence the name of the condition. Irregular periods are the other key symptom of PCOS.\n\nPCOS is thought to be caused by a number of things, partly including a genetic predisposition, and some studies have shown that women who have it in their family are more likely to have it themselves.

It’s also sometimes referred to as a sexually transmitted disease (STD), but there’s no real difference between what these two terms mean.\n\nThere are different kinds of STIs, all with different effects. We’ll go through that in more detail below. You might have heard the myth that ejaculation needs to occur for an STI to spread, but that isn’t the case. So make sure you’re protecting yourself from STDs right from the start of sexual contact (scroll down to find out how).\n\nIn 2020, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 374 million new infections, meaning more than 1 million STIs are acquired every day around the world. See why it’s important to clue yourself up on them now?\n\nThe good news is sexually transmitted infections are becoming more widely understood, leading to less shame and better knowledge around prevention and testing.\n\nWhat causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? \n\nSTIs are most often spread by unprotected sexual contact, which is why it’s important to use a barrier method of protection — such as a condom or dental dam — to protect yourself and your sexual partners. You can get these at family planning clinics, in drugstores, or via your health care provider.\n\nSome STIs can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, but this is less common.",

Consider making a meal of grilled salmon or salmon sushi for a dose of high-quality protein and plenty of B vitamins.\nDark chocolate\n\nYou probably don’t need another excuse to eat some chocolate. It’s undoubtedly one of the most popular foods to eat during your period for numerous reasons. Loaded with antioxidants and magnesium, dark chocolate is a great comfort food. \n\nTry to stick to plain dark chocolate as opposed to complex candy full of additives and other ingredients. These will only deliver empty calories with little to no health benefits. \n\nHowever, it's still important to consume chocolate in moderation since even dark chocolate contains sugar and caffeine.\nOatmeal\n\nOats are a whole grain rich in calcium and vitamins A and B, and they’re also a great source of iron. One cup contains about 14 of your daily recommended 18 milligrams of iron. One study found that a higher intake of the type of iron found in oatmeal was associated with a lower risk of PMS symptoms. Oatmeal is also a great option if you have an upset stomach.\nWatermelons, figs, and plums\n\nThe natural sugars found in these foods may satisfy cravings for something sweet. Additionally, these fruits are rich in vitamins that can help with bloating. Watermelon also has a high water content and can help keep your body hydrated, which will reduce swelling and bloating.\nCitrus\n\nA smart alternative to sugary treats, oranges, lemons, and limes are packed with fiber and vitamin C and can provide relief from mood swings and bloating. Meanwhile, their high water content also keeps you hydrated. \n\nCombat PMS-related nausea and fatigue with a glass of lemon water or a (lightly sweetened or unsweetened) citrus smoothie. Moderation is key for getting a dose of feel-good energy without irritating your stomach. \nEggs\n\nThe iron, fat-soluble nutrients, B vitamins, essential fatty acids, and protein in egg yolks do wonders for PMS. But if you have a sensitive stomach, avoid hard-boiled eggs, which can cause gas, bloating, and heartburn.\nChamomile\n\nLast on the list of foods to eat while on your period: chamomile tea. This soothing beverage can help relax your nerves and your uterus. It reduces the severity of cramps, squashes stress and anxiety, and even promotes better sleep.",

    "content": "It’s more than likely that you’ll have heard of menopause, but what about perimenopause?\n\nLike puberty, menopause is a natural transition in your cycle that’s marked by hormone changes and officially starts 12 months after your last period. However, your period doesn’t just stop overnight. The transition into menopause can last years. This is known as perimenopause.\n\nThe average age to experience menopause is between 45 and 55. However, perimenopause can begin anytime between your 30s and 50s. During this time, you’ll continue to have a period, but your ovaries start to produce less estrogen, meaning your cycle may become irregular.\n\nAny change to your menstrual cycle can be unsettling. So, from hot flashes to irregular periods, a menopause specialist talks to Flo about what to expect when you experience perimenopause. While everyone who has a period will go through perimenopause, that doesn’t mean that you have to go through difficult symptoms without medical support.\n\nWhat is perimenopause?\n\nAs mentioned above, perimenopause simply describes the transitional process into menopause. \n\nThe two important hormones to highlight in perimenopause are progesterone and estrogen. Estrogen plays a key role in your cycle. Your estrogen levels rise just before ovulation to trigger your ovaries to release an egg. Shortly following ovulation, your progesterone levels also rise to prepare your body for pregnancy. They then dip again before your period if the egg isn’t fertilized. \n\nWhen you enter perimenopause, the amount of estrogen produced by your ovaries decreases. This can lead to irregular periods and your progesterone levels being thrown off. For many people, perimenopause isn’t a straightforward process, and you might have a regular cycle one month and then a particularly long or short one the next. It can be helpful to monitor your cycle at this time with a period tracker like Flo.\n\nLubna Pal, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at Yale University, explains that irregular periods are often the first sign of perimenopause for many people. \n\nShe explains, “You could notice your cycles becoming a little bit shorter. You used to be 28 days. Now they’re 25 to 21 days. That may be the earliest clinical manifestation and the first sign of perimenopause.”\n\nIt’s important to note that even as your cycles become irregular, you can still get pregnant during perimenopause. So you should still consider using contraception if you don’t want to have a baby. ",

Where is the clitoris, and what does it do? But its job is actually pretty straightforward. \n\nYou can think of it as the feel-good center of the vulva and vagina. That’s because it’s the only part of the human body that is designed solely for pleasure — it literally has no other purpose. Pretty cool, right? \n\nConsidering how important it is for pleasure, you’re probably going to want to know exactly where the clitoris is. But if you aren’t quite sure of that or what it looks like, then you’d be forgiven. The clitoris is often presented as a mysterious and out-of-reach thing, and for that reason, your sex education class may have left it out entirely.\n\nHowever, as a key part of your anatomy, the clitoris shouldn’t be ignored. Here, two Flo experts break down everything you need to know about the small but mighty organ. \n\nFirstly, what is a clitoris? \n\nSince the clitoris is a part of your body, you might feel a little silly asking where it is. But with female pleasure having long been seen as taboo, it’s often not spoken about publicly. The result? It’s completely normal not to know basic information about it. \n\nBut because it’s super important that you understand the different parts of your vulva, let’s look into it. Your clitoris can be found just above the opening to your urethra (the tube that you pee out of), which is above the opening of your vagina, toward the front. Your clitoris might be covered by a thin layer of skin called a clitoral hood. You can learn more about the different parts of your anatomy and what they’re for using an app like Flo. ",

    "id": "2-0-0",
    "pic": "2-0-0.jpg",
    "tag": "Diseases",
    "content": "Joanne Messeri grew up with what her mom called a “nervous stomach.” Joanne, who beat ovarian cancer once and is currently battling it a second time, had experienced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) since she was young. So when her stomach started acting up more severely, at first she thought nothing of it.\n\nJoanne, who lives in Ohio, says, “I’ve had a nervous stomach my whole life. So, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea were normal for me.” But four years ago, after eventually seeking medical help, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After her first diagnosis, the treatment was effective and she was cancer-free, but she later had a recurrence.\n\nLike many others, Joanne’s experiences with IBS led her to dismiss her ovarian cancer symptoms initially. Dr. Amanda Kallen, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive endocrinology at Yale School of Medicine, explains why this is a common issue. “Unfortunately, some of the signs of ovarian cancer, such as abdominal bloating or fullness, change in appetite, indigestion, nausea, and changes in bowel movements, are similar to the signs of IBS, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis,” she says. \n\nOf course, the majority of people who notice these symptoms won’t have ovarian cancer. It’s always important to pay attention to your body’s signals, but it’s also important not to stress by worrying too much. As we’ll delve into later in this article, there are various causes of these kinds of digestive symptoms — and most have absolutely nothing to do with cancer.\n\nDismissing ovarian cancer as IBS bloat\n\nIBS is a disorder affecting the digestive system. We don’t know what causes it, although some experts have previously linked it to food passing through the gut too quickly or too slowly, having oversensitive nerves in the gut, or a family history of the disorder. Symptoms of IBS include: \n\nCramping\nAbdominal pain\nBloating\nConstipation\nDiarrhea\nGas\n\nFrustratingly, ovarian cancer symptoms can overlap with IBS symptoms, meaning they’re sometimes mistakenly dismissed as less serious than they actually are.\n\nWhen Joanne experienced her first symptoms of ovarian cancer — bloating and feeling full — she assumed the signs were part of her IBS. “I just didn’t pay any attention to it,” she says. Joanne also recalls needing to pee more often, as well as noticing “a feeling of fullness I never had before.” But she didn’t think much about it — or the pain she had been experiencing in her left hip bone. “I just figured I was exercising a lot,” she says. “I figured I strained a muscle during crunches.”\n\n“Determining whether symptoms are from ovarian cancer or from another cause can be complicated,” says Dr. Cynthia DeTata, a clinical assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. And sometimes, that can lead to a delayed diagnosis. \n\n“Unfortunately, ovarian cancer is often caught in later stages when symptoms become more obvious. But if we can catch ovarian cancer in the early stage, it could be treated early and potentially be curable,” she adds.",

    "content": "What is metastatic breast cancer?\n\nYou might have heard the term metastatic breast cancer but not be totally sure what it is. Simply put, metastatic breast cancer is the most advanced form of breast cancer (stage four or IV) — if cancer has metastasized, then it means that it has spread to other parts of the body. \n\nMetastatic breast cancer occurs when breast cancer cells break away from the tumor in your breast and pass through to your bloodstream or your lymphatic system (the network of thin tubes that carry fluid around your body). Once the cells have spread, they can then settle in other organs and form new tumors.\n\nMetastatic breast cancer survival rate\n\nAlthough this form of cancer isn’t curable, the good news is that it is very treatable. In fact, recent developments in treatment mean that people with a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis can have a better quality of life. The five-year survival rate after diagnosis for people with stage four breast cancer is 29%, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).  \n\nDr. Eleonora Teplinsky, head of breast medical oncology at Valley Health System, says: “We have made remarkable strides in breast cancer in the last decade. New drugs keep getting approved. We’re seeing improved survival. People are able to live their lives, work, travel, and be with their families.” \n\nIf you’ve recently received a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis, then you may well feel frightened and overwhelmed. Those feelings are completely valid and normal. Your health care provider will be able to walk you through treatment options and provide information on emotional support for you and your loved ones. \n\nBelow, Dr. Teplinsky explains everything you need to know about metastatic breast cancer, including symptoms and how it’s diagnosed.",

    "content": "The first few months of pregnancy can be a really exciting time, and one piece of information that can feel particularly crucial is your due date. Pop culture has long portrayed pregnancy as a nine-month countdown to birth. But how long is pregnancy? Working this out can actually be a little bit more complicated than that. \n\n“From a medical standpoint, doctors always talk in weeks and days,” says obstetrician, gynecologist (OB-GYN), and Flo medical board member Dr. Charlsie Celestine. “A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks long, which equals 10 months. Yet commonly, people talk about pregnancy as being nine months long.” \n\nHang on. 10 months, not nine? How can that be the case? According to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, the average length of human gestation is 280 days or 40 weeks, and that time starts from the first day of your last period, when you’re not technically pregnant yet. That’s because ovulation (which happens midway through your cycle) and fertilization haven’t occurred yet — but more on that later.\n\nNo two pregnancies are the same, and pregnancies can vary in length. Here, Dr. Celestine explains why pregnancy is often referred to as nine months and how your due date is calculated.\n\nHow long is a full-term pregnancy in months and weeks?\n\nIf most full-term pregnancies (when a baby is born between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days) last 10 months, then you’ll probably be wondering where the idea of nine months comes from. \n\nThis confusion about how we refer to pregnancy length could be related to the fact that most people don’t find out that they’re pregnant until they’ve missed a period, which is already approximately four weeks into the pregnancy. “Everything is based on your cycle,” says Dr. Celestine.

But if you're still not completely clear on what gestational age actually is, we're here to help. \n\nGestational age describes where you are in your pregnancy. It’s measured from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) to the current date, typically in weeks. Usually, pregnancies last anywhere from 38 to 42 weeks; babies born before the 37-week marker are considered premature.\n\nHow to understand gestational age\n\nLMP refers to the first day of your last menstrual period. Health care providers measure pregnancies in weeks starting from the first day of the LMP. If your period is regular and lasts 28 days, and if ovulation generally happens on day 14 of your cycle, then conception probably took place about two weeks after the LMP. For gestational age counting, these two weeks are added to a pregnancy as a simpler method than trying to track from ovulation or fertilization.\n\nNevertheless, this estimation is not always accurate. It doesn't take into account factors like changes in the menstrual cycle, variations in ovulation, and imperfect recall by patients.\n\nA due date calendar or calculator can help pregnant people determine their baby’s due date. \n\nTo calculate your due date, add 280 days (40 weeks) to the first day of your LMP (if you have a 28-day cycle). \n\nDifferent calculators can help determine your due date based on ovulation, date of conception, and ultrasound data.

Plus, you can download our handy printable hospital bag checklist PDF if you keep scrolling.   \n\nWhat week should you pack your hospital bag?\n\nPreparation is key, right? While Dr. Boyle says there’s not really such a thing as packing too soon, she advises pulling together your hospital bag when you’re 36 weeks pregnant. “As you get closer to giving birth, you’ll have a better sense of what you really need and what will help you the most,” she says. “However, people who are at an increased risk of having a premature birth should start packing a little sooner. This would include anyone who is pregnant with multiples, like twins or triplets, or who has had a prior preterm birth,” she adds.\n\n“Some labors start slowly with lots of early contractions, and although you would have plenty of time to pack during this early stage, it’s still nice to have everything ready to go so that you can focus on staying comfortable during early labor,” Dr. Boyle explains. “Other labors, especially if you have already had a baby, can start quickly, so having your bags ready to go is super helpful.”\n\nEven if you’re planning a home birth, Dr. Boyle still suggests having a newborn hospital bag packed and ready to go, just in case you need to go to the hospital unexpectedly.\n\nWhat to pack in a hospital bag for labor\n\nBelow, we’ll run through essential things to pack for mom and baby, things another parent or partner might need, and some optional items that could make your experience more comfortable. We’ll also detail what the hospital will typically provide while you’re in labor so you won’t need to worry about packing that. \n\nOf course, every birthing hospital bag will be different based on your personal needs and the country where you’re giving birth, so pack according to your situation.

    "content": "Sudden moods swings and tearfulness are symptoms that occur in up to 85% mothers in the first few days after childbirth and are commonly known as the baby blues. In general, they are nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter delivery, the levels of female hormones estrogen and progesterone drop abruptly. These hormonal changes may affect the mood causing the baby blues. In most cases, the symptoms vanish within 1-2 weeks, after hormonal levels have stabilized.\n\nPostpartum depression is different from baby blues, more severe and lasting. Around 15% of new mothers experience it.\n\nUnlike the baby blues, postpartum depression may occur at any time during the first year, most often in the first 4 months after the baby was born. A woman with postpartum depression needs professional help. \n\nPostpartum depression may be triggered by one or more of the following:\n\n– Hormonal changes. Women with postpartum depression may respond more sensibly to the hormonal changes in the postpartum period and while breastfeeding.\n\n– Poor social support. Caring for a newborn and breastfeeding is a 24/7 job and often goes along with sleep deprivation. Mothers are in need of support from their partner, friends, relatives, or other associates. Single mothers and women with financial or housing problems are at higher risk of developing postpartum depression.\n\n– Stressful life events. Partnership conflicts, domestic violence, and the loss of a close family member are a risk factor for depression in general. It may lead to postpartum depression as well.\n\nHow to prevent depression\n\nPrevention starts before the baby is born and depression may develop not only after, but also during pregnancy.\n\nBeing well prepared for motherhood can be helpful to prevent postpartum depression. In antenatal classes, women have the opportunity to discuss their future motherhood, share their concerns, and endorse each other.\n\nA new mother should have enough time to rest and should take care of having regular healthy meals.\n\nWhen you’re raising a child, it’s nice to have a family or friends supporting you. They can help you with the baby and in householding tasks. They can also act as confidants. Sharing your feelings and frustrations is important for mental health.\n\nWhen to call a doctor\n\nIn general, you should call a doctor if sadness, irritability, or anxiety last for more than 2 weeks and interfere with your ability to care for yourself and the child.\n\nYou may also need a doctor’s help if any of the following signs are present:\n\nNot being able to sleep or being tired and exhausted all the time\n\nPoor appetite\n\nFeeling even small tasks are hard to complete\n\nFeeling highly critical of yourself or others\n\nWorrying about the baby all the time\n\nHaving thoughts of harming yourself or the baby\n\nBottom line\n\nIn most cases, a slight mood decline after childbirth is normal and goes away within 2 weeks. If it doesn’t and symptoms of depression persist, psychological therapy and medications prescribed by a doctor are, in general, efficient options to relieve them.",

Having your baby close to you may make night feeds feel more manageable or give you the peace of mind that you can soothe them immediately when they wake up. It’s widely recommended that the safest way for your baby to sleep is in their own space, on their back, without any additional blankets, pillows, or bumpers. However, if you decide to co-sleep, then here are some tips to make it as safe as possible.\n\nIf you have considered co-sleeping at any point, then you’re not alone. A study published in the Handbook of Cross-Cultural Human Development estimated that 44% of US infants between the ages of 2 to 9 months “always,” “almost always,” or “sometimes” co-slept with their parents or guardians. Similarly, the charity, The Lullaby Trust, found that 76% of the 8,500 British parents they surveyed had co-slept with their baby at some point. \n\nMaking decisions about sleeping following the birth of your baby can feel daunting, and putting your baby’s safety first is key. Online guidance can be inconsistent or even contradictory, which can make the whole thing seem even more confusing. That’s why we’ve broken down everything you need to know about co-sleeping below, including some of the things you should consider so it’s as safe as possible.\n\nWhat is co-sleeping?\n\nCo-sleeping is when you choose to sleep in the same bed, on the same surface, or close by in the same room as your child. Some parents choose to attach their baby’s bassinet directly to their bed or switch between sleeping in the bed together and putting their baby in their crib. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s a sleeping arrangement that 61% of families sometimes or often use. \n\nWhile it isn’t uncommon, co-sleeping has long divided opinions between parents and experts. For people who breastfeed, studies have suggested that co-sleeping can be beneficial. An Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine study found that it “promotes breastfeeding initiation.” Similarly, research published in the Journal of Human Lactation supported the idea that there are links between co-sleeping (or room sharing) and longer breastfeeding durations.
